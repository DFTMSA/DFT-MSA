Repository for solving the one-dimensional Poisson problem including ion-ion correlation, using density functional theory and the mean sphere approximation (DFT-MSA). This allows computation of the electric potential and ion concentration profiles between two charged plates, for a sodium-calcium-chloride solution.

Currently only a MATLAB version is available.

Two files are available:
- DFTMSA_solver.m is the main function
- DFTMSA_example.m shows an example file on how to use the main function
